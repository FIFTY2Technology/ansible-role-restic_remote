# Check for the existence of various systemd service files. In case they are
# present, the corresponding remote '.timer' will be activated on the backup
# server. If a service (e.g. 'restic-exporter.service') is not found on the
# remote client, it means the related role was not run on the specific host - in
# this case it doesn't make sense to start the service via a remote '.timer'.
# The corresponding remote timers get activated in 'tasks/configure_server.yml'.
