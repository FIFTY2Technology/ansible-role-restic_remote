Dots are not allowed in .htpasswd usernames, so we replace them with '_'.

HTTPS is assumed for all rest servers

The repositories on our rest-server are configured per-machine and a single
user is responsible for a complete system-backup. The backup destination
can be accessed as follows:
rest:             specifies the connection protocol for the restic clientto use
                  for the remote storage.
https://          authentication and data transfer happens over HTTPS.
<client-hostname> The clients hostname is also its username for authentication
                  against REST. Dots are replaced by underscores.
:                 Field separator between username and password.
<password>        The clients password used for authentication agains the REST
                  server. Should only contain alphanumerical characters.
@                 Field separator between username:password and host:port.
<server-hostname> Target servers FQDN the client sends backups to. The FQDN is
                  derived from the inventory group 'backupservers', but gets
                  manipulated by '/etc/hosts' file for remote clients
                  (points to 127.0.0.1).
                  This cannot be set to 'localhost' directly on remote clients
                  because then the hostname of the rest-server's TLS certificate
                  would not match anymore.
:                 Field separator between host and port.
<port>            TCP port where the remote REST server is listening on after
                  the backup server established the SSH connection. See
                  'restic_remote_client_port' in 'restic_remote' role.
/<path>           Path to repository as reflected 1:1 on the server
                  (our default: the clients hostname).
